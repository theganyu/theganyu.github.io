# About me

I am currently a Post-doctoral Fellow at [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo). I obtained the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Macau. 

I specialize in the automation of robotic systems, with a specific emphasis on quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles. My research endeavors within this discipline encompass a comprehensive investigation into the domains of control, estimation, and motion planning.
