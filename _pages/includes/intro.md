# About me

I am currently a Research Assistant Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Prior to this, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the University of Macau, which was subsequently followed by a postdoctoral experience at the same institution.

Please note, my previous email address, <s>ganyu@um.edu.mo</s>, is no longer in use. For any future correspondence, kindly reach me at sjtuganyu@sjtu.edu.cn.

I specialize in the automation of robotic systems, with a specific emphasis on quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles. My research endeavors within this discipline encompass a comprehensive investigation into the domains of control, estimation, and motion planning, aiming to advance this field with innovative insights and practical solutions.
