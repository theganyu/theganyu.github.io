I obtained the qualification as a doctoral advisor at SJTU in 2024. Should you be interested in working with me as a Ph.D. or master's student in Control Science and Engineering, please feel free to contact me via email.

I specialize in the automation of robotic systems, particularly focusing on quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles and spacecraft. My research endeavors within this discipline encompass a comprehensive investigation into the domains of control, estimation, and motion planning, aiming to advance this field with innovative insights and practical solutions.
