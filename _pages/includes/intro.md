Should you be interested in collaborating with me as a Ph.D. student or Postdoctoral Fellow, kindly reach out to me via email.

I specialize in the automation of robotic systems, with a specific emphasis on quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles. My research endeavors within this discipline encompass a comprehensive investigation into the domains of control, estimation, and motion planning, aiming to advance this field with innovative insights and practical solutions.
